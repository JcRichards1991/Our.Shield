<h4>Backoffice Access</h4>

<p>
    Backoffice Access gives you the ability to configure the backoffice access url - by default & out-of-the-box, it's /umbraco/ -
    Allows you to restrict your desired backoffice access url via a white-list of IP Address(es) and rewrite or redirect unauthorised
    access to a location of your choice via:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Static string - i.e. "/404-not-found"
        </li>
        <li>
            XPath expression - i.e. "/root/homepage/standardPage[@isDoc AND @nodeName = '404 Not Found']"
            <br />
            OR
        </li>
        <li>
            Using a content picker
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Note</strong>: Disabling Backoffice Access will reset the access url back to being "/umbraco"
